# NIZKCTF upstream repository

This is the upstream repository for the Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge CTF platform, a distributed and openly auditable CTF platform that uses zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to submit and verify the flags for Capture The Flag competitions. It works from command line, but we also have a [javascript version](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF-js) to have an easier and more friendly interface.

The paper describing the platform can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05844.pdf).

If you want to host your CTF using the platform, fork this repository and follow the instructions on the [NIZKCTF-tutorial repository](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/nizkctf-tutorial). We have also developed a [dynamic provisioner](https://github.com/pwn2winctf/NIZKCTF-provisioning) for isolated challenges if you need it. Contact us if you need any help.
